    "## Introduction to lazy processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy processing refers to the use of [out-of-core computation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm) to process very large data, which are usually too large to fit into the computer's memory at one time. The main idea is to chunk the data in pieces, small enough, that can be processed in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperSpy internally uses the [dask library](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/index.html), which implements the numpy interface to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. The typically workflow for processing data lazily which is on a disk:\n",
    "1. \"load\" data from disk with a defined chunking\n",
    "2. schedule operations\n",
    "3. do the computation\n",

    "#### Cropping data\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we do not need the whole signal dimension for our processing. In those cases, the processing can be sped up by cropping out the parts of the signal dimensions you don't need.\n",

    "This is due to how `map` works: it sends the full signal dimension to the function you specify. This can lead to a lot of unecessary data being read and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one possibility, is to use `isig` to \"crop\" parts of the signal dimensions. Note: to get the most performance improvements, remove as many **chunks** as possible. Remember that if you include one value from a chunk, the whole chunk needs to be read into memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: if we have a chunking `(64, 64, 64, 64)`, a datashape `(256, 256, 256, 256)` in our dataset, and we use `isig[64:192, 64:192]`, we only need to load `25%` of the dataset into memory. Since we only grab 4 of the 16 chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we instead use `isig[63:193, 63:193]`, we will now include all the chunks (16), `100%` of the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "So keep the chunking size in mind when doing cropping!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets compare this, one where we crop using `isig[64:192, 64:192]`, which gives us the 4 signal (diffraction) chunks in the middle. And one where we crop using `s.isig[63:193, 63:193]`, where we get all the chunks."
